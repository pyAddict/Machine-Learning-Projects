"iPhone 5s was first released 2 years ago in November 2014.I am still a fan of iPhone 5s, over newer 6 or 6s. It's much cheaper then iphone 6 and 6s, but with all the same features including fingerprint authentication and a powerful 64-Bit processor. If a bigger screen is not your priority then this is a good cheaper iPhone.Now the important Question: Is it original with India Warranty?Answer: YES. I bought it from 'Gadgets_Guru' seller. Took phone to Authorized Apple service center, and got it verified, It had valid 1 year warranty in India.Printed price on box is Rs.35,000 and I got it from amazon for Rs.28,300.UPDATE: Apple has further reduced price of iPhone 5s, and is now available around Rs.21,500. The price keep fluctuating between Gold, Silver and Black color, make sure you check price for all the colors.Side note: The box came with 2.1 Ampere Charger, which comes with iPhone 6s and iPad. Previously iPhones use to ship with 1-Ampere charger, and I believe apple is now putting same 2.1 Ampere Charger with old generation iPhone too. This is a GOOD THING, it charges twice as fast.--One last thing, Please hit YES Button if you found my review HELPFUL",1.0

"In the past 4 years I have owned Android and (the now virtually redundant) Blackberry phones prior to buying an iPhone 5s last year. Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great5. The ring tone & speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtfulGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repairOverall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, except the 64 bit architecture the 5s for me is the King of cellphones in 20k budget.(ignoring unreliable Chinese brandsFinally, a lot of reviews posted on amazon are from buyers who are unable to transfer their data from android. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone or search on you tube and learn the way to do it.Tip- Please buy from amazon fulfilled seller for genuine phones.Thanks for your time.",1.0

I had returned the i phone on the very fourth day of my purchase as there if flow of electricity near the charging port during charging and it is also giving mild electrical shock when touched there bare foot. When tested with a tester the light in it glowing brightly so much electricity the rear body is pumping out. Please see the photo attached. This is the quality of the so called i phone. Beware every one.Also this is a genuine product as I verified from apple site. Apple should not deliver to this country such third grade products without testing their quality.The plus point is service of Amazon is excellent.,0.0
"I have not purchased this phone from Amazon but from some other e-commerce site.To all those who have bought this phone online and are worried about the text printed behind the phone, please do not worry, the ""self declaration - confirming to IS 13252 (Part 1):2010, R-4******** is being printed on all the mobile phones manufactured and sold after May 2015.It has been mandatory by the BIS (The Bureau of Indian Standards)I have a moto g3 phone and when I open the back casing the same thing is printed on it too. Same on my iPhone 6 as well.But it was not printed on my iPhone 4 because it was manufactured in 2013.Please do not worry, these Apple phones come with genuine Apple warranty for 12 months and 4 months of phone support. Buy online from a trusted seller :)The phone manufacturing month and import month is November 2015 and comes with ios 9.1 pre installed. I updated it to ios 9.2. Checked the warranty on the Apple support site and its valid till 24th December 2016 and the apple phone support till March 2016",1.0
"I switched from iPhone 4 to 5s and this phone is really really great for the price it is being sold at right now. Would totally recommend it to peeps who wanna use an iPhone but have a low budget. The camera, processing speed, game play, body weight and size is great for a correctly sized (mostly known as small sized) phone. Before opening the box I checked the IMEI number on apple's website and the phone was showing as not activated, and after setting up my phone I checked it again and it was showing me a years date for limited warranty from the day I started using it, hence it's a brand new, untouched, sealed pack phone. Thanks to the seller for that.",1.0

"Awesome product, great looks,right weight, nice camera, flash is average,value for money. But the product has one serious issue. EarPods are not working, Amazon 's replacement policy is not customer friendly. They will collect the product and later, send a replacement.",1.0

Giving feedback after using iPhone 5S last 25 days. I ordered this phone on Amazon Diwali Dhamaka deal @ 29999. I got amazing deal with best price. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date.,1.0
"Mine came in a sealed box, charger seemed a little bulkier than usual but the phone itself seems to be of good quality. Checked the serial numbers online in the apple website, seems legit. Good performance, excellent camera and the look of the phone is simply stunning. Got it at a discounted price, simply loved the colours and the finish. Liked it much more than iPhone 6, overall a very satisfactory buy. Thank you Amazon.",1.0
I was getting problem with front camera and when visited to apple care. They told me that product was not fresh and someone has already played with its hardware. The cost to repair hardware to make camera work is 21000 and it is worst product of Amazon. I am totally unhappy with amazon and suggest you not to buy costly products on amazon.,0.0
"I want to keep the review short and simple. An iPhone is an iPhone and nothing can replace it. Let technology simplifies ones life and the one mediated through iPhone exactly does that. Firstly I got a defective product and it was a bit disappointing, however, when requested to Amazon they replaced with an another one which is working absolutely fine. Thank you Apple and thank you to Amazon too for your services as my first iPhone experience is overwhelming. :) Cheers!",1.0
"Bought this to gift my brother on his birthday. Amazon packing was good and item delivered was good and no problem with the product even after 7 months. As it is an Apple product i've not come across any performance issues to complain here. Just felt that should have gone for 32GB or 64GB because 16GB storage isn't sufficient at all. AFter 300-500 pics, memory will be used up and then regret starts. Overall product is good.",1.0

"WOWza! brand new and orignal product, confirmed the same after registering the phone with apple(i purchased from the seller CLOUDTAIL during special promotions on the Diwali Sale, got it at the mind blowing price of Rs 16300 (after accounting for HDFC cashback offer).thank you amazon for this amazong deal, glad i did not fall for 6s sale which was by some other seller, i think seller makes all the difference while buying iphone online, ws retail on flipkart and cloudtail on amazon.cheers.",1.0
"The product was received on time and with good & firm packaging. The product however is not as described! It says the phone is a new one, but you can verify that with the serial no on Apple's website. The phone I received was manufactured in 2013. Most likely this is a refurbished product, good news the website confirmed a year's warranty on this old manufactured phone. Guess that's more assuring than the description. Over all a good phone, didn't face any issues up till now.",0.0
"Ordered this phone just last week, it's a defective piece the device while restarting shows blue screen of death and it's a looping issue it reboots and shows blue screen tried to return the device but could not do so as amazon policy says customer has to provide the apple service center report that they have worked on it and could not fix it then only amazon will replace it . It was a really bad experience I am not going to order any thing from amazon now on .",0.0
"Delivery: On time and good packing by sellers GadgetDirect and ThinkGeek.Warranty: Checked the serial number on Apple site and no problem with 1 year warranty from the date I activated phone.Performance: 10/10Stability: 9/10Consistency: 10/10Looks: 10/10Sound: 9/10Camera: 8/10Design: 10/10Privacy Control: 10/10Battery Backup: 7/10Compatibility: 2/10Overall: 8.5 out of 10.(+) Performance - Apple designs both hardware and software so even the seemingly ordinary specs deliver vertex of performance.(+) Stability - No abnormal reboot or termination of applications. This phone doesn't hang.(+) Consistency - What performance and stability you are getting today, it won't diminish with time. Your phone remains same after months and years.(+) Looks - I have Space Grey color. The appearance is ineffable, I'd call it verbatim beauty.(+) Sound - Crisp and clean. Speakers are loud enough without leaking the sound. Put it close to ears and you will hear delicate punches of bass!(+) Camera - Don't expect SLR segment. Snaps in day and night both can be tagged on decent mark.(+) Design - 4"" is business elegance. Comfortable to hold and operate by single hand. This could be last offering from Apple in 4"" segment.(+) Privacy Control - One must factor that this phone delivers. No application can play stunts accessing any of your information without permission.(+) Battery Backup - Around 22 hours with normal usage and WiFi on. Charging takes 2 hours.(-) Compatibility - This is where new users need to think. You can't just connect a USB cable and copy files in a trice from PC. Peering with any other phone is not available. Apple talks with Apple devices or through safe passage of iTunes. However, these constraints only give Apple the matchless stability and security.Deficiencies:Apple map is not accurate so download Google map which is a minute worth task. Siri is not fluent with Indian accent as Google voice but she tries to learn. The text keyboard has odd placement of period (.) key, it's in in numerics keypad which is bit tedious while composing emails and message. On few 32 GB handsets there may be a slight yellow tint. Apple support claims its just the color profile / variance and not an issue. Depends now on user if they get adjusted as it might make their color preference look better. I though opted a neutral one. Last, this is a very delicate gadget and need to be handled carefully or with protective covers. ""A drop can result exorbitant repair charges.""Final Say:This phone has the outstanding combination of consistent performance and appearance. If compatibility is not an issue then this phone by no means would let you down on the paid price. IOS 9 will enhance the performance further as it will be half the size of IOS 8.",1.0
Today I received brand new set of Apple iPhone 5s. It's mfg in the month of April this year. It's very good brand new phone with Apple india warranty. Seller is highly recommended. I will use the phone and I will review in detail later.,1.0
Yes phone was a new however the charger was that of iPad. Phone may get damaged now if I charge with that charger. I think this has to be conveyed to apple and Amazon that the package was containing wrong materials.,0.0

"I love apple's products. No any brand/company can take apple's place. I use iphones from last 10 years. My first iphone was 2G even when apple's any product not launch in india.now i have iphone 6s. But i buy iphone 5s for my dad. He is new to use apple's iOS product(iphone5s). He is very excited to use iphone 5s. Yeepee i got 5s in only 20500? on deal. Packing was great & Delivery was on time as amazon do always perfect. Guys din't worry apple's any product is perfect just ignore 1,2,3 star's and negative comments. Illiterate people who don't know how to use iphone those kind of people do negative comments/feed back. Just ignore those craps.

Absolutely loving this product. I am new to apple environment and still leaning few tricks. Amazon delivered this product before time and yes this is brand new Iphone with manufacturing date of Jan 2016 with pre installed IOS 9.2. This is a genuine product as I have confirmed this from apple site.32GB Iphone 5S below 25k is worth a deal.,1.0
"I have used android and windows phones before this for 4 years and was looking at iphone for some time .Now that the prices are bit customer friendly, decided to finally go for it.Firstly i was thinking of buying 6 or 6s but if you are new user and want to check out iphone and capabilities then 5s is great for you. Do not Buy 16gb one if you plan to listen to music and click few photos. as about 4-5 gb is taken by os and you will have only  11 gb. I bought 32 gb and been using it for about 3 days now.Must say this is the best smartphone I have used. And android and windows does not come near this.I don't want to write features review etc. but having used android and windows before this, can safely say that this is the best one.5s will serve  your needs just great.go for 32gb.Got original product from amazon and warranty checked.Delighted to own an iphone and not just because it's an iPhone but it's simply the best smartphone out there.Don't think twice.",1.0
Very very good product a must bye for all having a tight budget . This phone is amazing the packing the box the lock is really great . One really minor setback to this amazing phone.

THEY ARE REALLY WORTH BUYING. EVERY PENNY I SPENT ON THEM IS WORTH. I DONT PUT CASES ON MY PHONE WHICH LEAVE ME WITH WONDERFUL FEELING OF HOLDING SUCH A FINELY CRAFTED PHONE.I BOUGHT TWO 5S IN 2016, ITS ALMOST 3 YEARS SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION BUT I BET NONE OF YOU CAN FEEL THE SLUGGISHNESS IN THE PHONE ON NORMAL DAY TO DAY USAGE. I PLAY GRAPHIC INTENSE GAMES LIKE NOVA 3 AND MODERN COMBAT 5, BOTH RUNS PREETY GOOD.FOR ME BEING A 5S ADDICT CANT FIGURE OUT A SINGLE FAULT IN THIS PHONE. ANYONE CAN LIVE WITH THIS PHONE HAPPILY.",1.0
I selected 1 day delivery and got it. The phone came packed in original Apple packing--exactly like it would be in any Apple store worldwide. I could set up the phone in 15 minutes and update to new IOS 8.3. I have other iphones and this one is for my son. We use the same Apple user ID so I don't have to buy the apps I have purchased earlier. My apps synced with iCloud and setting up the new phone for use is very easy. Would recommend all to buy the iphone 5s from Amazon.,1.0
I ordered this phone from amazon on 09 Nov 2015 and it was delivered on 12 Nov 2015. Phone is in absolutely in New condition. Phone runs fine and there is not such a major issue with it. But two things I noticed about this phone1. First was that left speaker in the bottom of phone produces extremely low sound or I may say that It's not working at all.2. Second one is when I play NFS on iPhone for 5-10 minutes it's back start heating (not very high but noticeable). Although the issue of speaker doesn't bother me as rarely I use speakers and the sound is coming perfect in the earphone. The other speaker is already working for producing good sound (But the second one should also have been working).Overall a good experience with phone with features and price but a bit disappointed with the non working speaker and heating slighting while playing game.,1.0
"5s is the best phone you can buy when it comes to the build quality. I bought it yesterday from amazon, seller : gadget direct. Before receiving the phone i was worried about if i got a fake one or damaged product, but none of that happened. Got a perfect phone. So let me list down the pros and cons.Pros1- comes with ios 9.2.12- no lag whatsoever3- amazing display and build quality4-camera is awesome5-finger print scanner works like a charm6- comes handy with 4 inch display.Cons:1-heating issue. It heats up with very normal usage2- battery drains out real quick. But charging it up takes a little time, so it neutralizez it.",1.0
"Credible, time tested phone received in excellent condition. Delivery was also prompt. I am happy with the i phone 5s, which I have purchased for my father. I think recently launched I phones are beyond reach of average Indian smartphone buyer. In spite of excellent product quality, Apple is likely to loose ground in our country due to Such overpricing.",1.0
"Sweet phone, ordered it as soon as the price dropped to 21.5K. Running ios 9.2 now, smooth and clean.Would not recommend the 16 GB version since you will definitely run into space issues very very fast. Consider the 32 GB version, the extra dough is definitely worth spending for an additional 16GB space. 16 GB works for me coz I am not a heavy app/music user. My requirement is around running basic apps with some social networking and messaging. Phone meets my requirements perfectly.Amazon service and delivery was up to the mark. No delays and good packing. So 5 Star!!",1.0
"Right after receiving the product you can check if the product is genuine or fake just goto https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do and enter serial number of your iphone if u are doing above procedure before even switching on your iphone they it will give a msg ""No details for the above product found"" else it will show you today's date and under one year of warranty.",1.0
"Awesome product from Apple ever. I had purchased this product from Amazon to add upto my apple environment at home. At first I was little worried whether to purchase it from e-retail store or from some offline store as most of the e-comm websites including Amazon did not mention anything about 4G support which is the main reason I am upgrading from Samsung S4. Since I found a great deal from Amazon I booked it on the night of January 25th. Then I had sent my query to Cloudtail, who is the selling this product in Amazon. Amazing thing is I got an instant reply from the Cloudtail about its 4G compatibility. I got the product delivered to me on January 26th Morning even though I did not opt for express service. The product is 100% genuine apple iPhone. It is imported version and it is compatible to Airtel 4G LTE services. As Airtel uses 2300Mz range for 4G services or Band-40. Most of the imported phones especially imported from US are not supported in India 4G services.Thanks for Amazon for providing me best deal and amazing experience.",1.0
"This phone had heating issues, charger problem, audio issue when on call. I guess amazon is selling deFect products.

I first ordered the iPhone on paytm but they are bad and they provided me defective set. After that I shifted again to Amazon because I trust them! And now I'm writing this review from the same iPhone ! iPhone is good and perfect ! I've checked the warranty on apple website and it clearly telling me that my iPhone is genuine ! Thanks Amazon !,1.0
"I was purchased my Phone , and when I switch  on of  my phone so no sound came from phone so I was inserted SIM in it and Started the phone and That time I feel the ringer of my iPhone 5s is not working.

"1. Getting difficult to answer calls as the swipe function doesn't move at times, not sure what's the cause.2. Original white box external box seems to have been damaged, how can it have stains when the box is supposed to covered by transparent polythene, stains everywhere which tells that the package has been opened and repacked so as to appear new.3. I have a feeling that it's a refurbished phone and not a new phone. Am a regular user of iPhone / apple products for many years, something wrong with this phone and seller",0.0
"I bought it to gift my wife who was looking for a handy 4 inch phone. After reading multiple reviews about fake mobiles in online sales, I thought of checking the authenticity. Though the phone looked very new, I thought of calling the iPhone customer to confirm if the  iPhone that I bought is genuine. Got to know that the product is original and has 356 days of warranty remaining. This cleared my major problem.I was using iPhone 5 earlier and currently using 6plus. When I compare it with iPhone 5, this phone is way better and complete value for money. Getting a good phone for less than 21k with Apple brand wasn't so easy earlier. But, Apple finally realised the price war in India and put a competitive price that tempts a lot of people like me. The phone is currently running with 9.2 iOS and absolutely there was no issue so far in terms of operating. Before buying the only other phone I looked was oneplus x. The display in oneplus x is excellent but as an expert of using android and apple mobiles in the past I decided to go for 5s by paying 4K extra which worth considering the brand and durability.Thanks to amazon and gabbardeals for providing a genuine product for competitive price. If you have a dream of owning a iPhone and of you are happy with small phones with 4inch display, without any doubts you can buy this. This will be a complete value for money. iPhones never get older and you will have good buyback when you want to upgrade.Finally, as soon as you buy the phone please check if the product is genuine by calling Apple support. If you find that it's not original you can return it else be like a happy customer like me :)Happy shopping!",1.0
I received this phone on the 24/5/2015. I was very excited but just after 3 days of usage the phone is overheating very quickly and in app sounds have just dissapeared. There is no volume in any of apps but the ringtone and everything are still working. It's overall a superb phone by apple but something faulty with the retailer maybe. I would still recommend this phone but maybe not from Cloudtail. I'm gonna talk to Amazon about this....,0.0

"Hi guys,Rocking commitment and delivery from Amazon I ordered for the iPhone 5s on 28 mar Mng 8am I received the product on same day. Kudos for Amazon for delivering on time.....So far the product is concern over all performance is good.

"Seller is awesome! Ordered the phone on FEB-25 and got it on 26. Genuine Product.Model A-1530 - compatible with India LTE band and has One year warranty.I was and Andriod user for 3 years. Got fed up with the Lolipop update. It made my phone (Moto g 1st Gen) slower.Hence went for the iphone.Pros:App interface is different from Android, its simple.Camera is awesomeStandby time is really awesome!you wont be disappointed.Cons:Compared to Android it is IOS is little restricted :) , you will get used to ititunes is something which I am still getting used to.Its does get heated up after heavy usage, which is normal with any product.Since it is a metal body the intensity is slightly more. It also depends on the room temp.Battery life: it varies from 4hrs to 10hrs depending on how heavy the usage is. There are days when I have got it for 17hrs as well. Don't worry about it.",1.0
I believe that not intro needed for apple products. This is my 3rd apple product and living to the expectation. Being it software or hardware apple inc craft the products to its perfection. And the packing and delivery by amazon is excellent.,1.0
"Talking about the positives of this phone is not necessary because most people already know it! The phone was in good condition,the delivery was prompt,no hassles..the gold iphone has a sexy look to it and at just 38K it was more than just worth it! This phone is for folks who just wanna get their work done without any issues or delay! If you want 100 latest features as and when they come,you need an android device but if you want the relatively new features to work 100% without fail or any glitches ios devices wont disappoint you!",1.0
"If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPhone! Well said by Apple. Well, straightaway telling you, if you fond of big and larger screen phone, it is not for you! Switching back from 5"" or larger screen phone to iPhone will not satisfy you in terms of its display. Over all it's very light, touch is nice, rest it's an iPhone so no need to write much. With respect to purchase an iPhone from Amazon is excellent experience. Of course phone comes with Apple Warranty. No need to worry about that. It came with iOS 9.2.2 genuinely. Well if you're an Apple fan and want to use Apple in this price you can definitely go for iPhone 5S otherwise there are many brands available by spending 2-3k more like OnePlus Oppo etc.",1.0
Superb phone with a very good price. No need to tell explicitly about the features of IPhone. Was very afraid about the 'genuinity' before buying this product but Amazon really kept its promise.

Complete disaster. Observed in the first call made with the phone that person on the other side could not hear anything while I kept my phone speaker on.It’s a failure of primary function.

"When we buy an iPhone we know what we want and are getting, so I'll keep my review focused on the Amazon.in product experience as that's what most people are concerned about (for Amazon fulfilled iPhone, for something so expensive unless it's from Croma etc, going for anything not Amazon fulfilled isn't wise!).- Product was from Apple India, and imported about two months prior to my purchase, with all relevant stickers and packaging intact. Both external and internal packing appeared to be original with no tampering.- Product was not registered currently to anyone, a check on Apple's warranty checker allowed me to verify that.- Was able to register the phone through iTunes and immediate warranty activation happened, and a check on Apple's warranty checker allowed me to do that.- Pre-installed OS was iOS 8.1 (for a Jan15 manufactured device)- Did a recall check, and according to the Apple site this Serial number did not have those defects (battery, sleep/wake button) that impacted devices from last year- Delivery (in Metro) under 48 hours including a Sunday- As I was changing my phone from iPhone 4 to iPhone 5s, I had to get a nano SIM to replace my micro SIM (four hour activation process)- Seamless data backup and restore from my old phone running iOS7 running iOS 7.1.2 to this- For the first hour or so, there was a lot of heat from the back of the phone compared to my iPhone 4 and I was wondering if that was normal, but that problem went away.- Tax invoice came with delivery, seller on Amazon.in was Gadgetdirect",1.0
It's a genuine phone.Checked before unboxing the phone.Check here https://checkcoverage.apple.com/in/en/It will show 'Device not activated yet' then it is a genuine and new phone with full 1 year warranty.If it shows some info like warranty period that means its a used phone.Not sure what it will show about duplicate phone.If you face any issues after receiving a genuine iPhone you have to contact apple service center.Using this phone for more than 2 months. Didn't face any major issue.Only thing I felt is phone gets heated while using 3G.,1.0

"I5s is the best phone in the market, this I agree now. Only when you buy an apple device then only you realise why it's so much better than android or the stylish Windows phone. It's simply brilliant. Easy to use, superbly customised and a lavish look. This space grey model is more attractive.Plus, amazon does a great job.Full deserving 5stars for a wonderful product! ????????????????????",1.0
"Amazon shipping is very  prompt whatever  I order till now. Thanks to Amazon. And I got it in a good deal.Kindly bare with my english language.Excited to see my iPhone and want to use it to get the best out of it. But after using few days later I found that it is not  what I want from a company like Apple as people tells  that’s most innovative company.  I appreciate for the build quality and a good camera  but not excellent. I feel  like being cheated when my expectations not met with the phone.Its definitely not worth what we are paying for. And every year after releasing the new phone, immediately the other previous model prices will almost cut 50% of original price by Apple company itself. It directly sends a signal that their value is only 50%. Almost all apple products  manufacturing cost is 1/5th of it, it comes approximately $200.All apple products are NOT USER FRIENDLY  at all. You can't transfer anything and Bluetooth transfer not allowed ,  for every  small thing we need to do with ITUNES which is worst complex interface of software industry. In ITUNES you have only SYNC option (it will eat up your memory). If your memory is full then again you have to buy another iPhone as it is not expandable( It is actually a business trick ). If you send your data to iCloud then it is chargeable after 5GB. Dont send your personal or family pictures to iCloud becoz you need to use iPhone lifelong( this is another business trick ). If you buy apple product, First thing is costly, even if you bare that its again not useful to anything except calling purpose( Nokia 1100 will de best calling job) I have MacBook Pro, which is useless except browsing and all & I have iPod which little better, Coz at least i am using it for reading books, music, and movies. Now this iPhone is also utter waste becoz it will not solve my purpose of listening to music, reading books, usefulness of different applications.iPhone will not allow any data transfer except through apps. If you shut & locked air tight all the doors of your home and yelling like I AM SECURE then what is the use. All Apple products are just exactly like this. Then iPhones are utter waste and useless. Apple created a hype among their products that their products are best. Hype is like a air bubble as it bursts after some time. Peoples are buying to show up purpose among their friends but it will not actually serve  smart phone functions and uses.Many peoples told camera quality is very good but that’s not true. See in www.dxomark.com ([...]) website(which reviews DSLR cameras) Samsung S7, Google Pixel, HTC 10, Sony, Moto Z are in the TOP list, You will not find iPhone in the TOP slot.I will never ever buy any apple product in my life time.Hope Apple will reduce the sky rocketing prices like 60k-100k as lifetime of any mobile is 3 years.  ( For 100K i may get  Avenger  Cruise bike & its life is 15 years officially)  and will address all the CONs as below & above said.The following are thePROs1) Build quality ( Craftsmanship )2) Average camera( Not excellent )3) Nice music quality but supports only FLAC which may not get everywhere.CONs1) Over Priced2) Memory is not enough only 11 GB available ( OS eats up 5GB out of 16GB )3) Memory not expandable4) NOT USER FRIENDLY5) Data Transfer  Restrictions( bluetooth6) Complex IOS software7) High SAR value( in all apple iPhones)8) Hardware configurations  are decade old (Ok Lets think IOS may take less )9) Extra monthly iCloud,  Apple music charges  and paid apps10) irritating notifications ( may be for security reasons )11) Need extra laptop to use ITUNES application.12) Irrelavant updates ( some features may go off if you update software like Hotspot etc )",0.0
"its my first iphone.writing this review after using it for 5 months.i have been an old android user from the beginning.full marks from my side to apple for creating such a beauty 5/5 sturdy build and sleek metal adds up to its charm.Coming to the interface ios is bit restrictive than android but it has its own pros and cons.i really liked it very simple and easy to use no hassles.Screen size is perfect for me easy to handle.Got the cashback gift card as promised bu the seller and amazon.Heating issues in the beginning contacted apple care and voila working perfectly since then.at last,amazon is the right place to buy it.go for it blindfolded :p",1.0

"I am not a huge apple fan but I must say that they have done outstanding work making this phone.I suppose anyone reading through the reviews and actually looking to buy the phone needs to here pros for this piece. So here, I will point out the possible cons which I felt I should have known earlier -1. The piece came without the seal cover, however the warranty was intact and as far as I could tell the piece was not used earlier.2. 5s uses a nano (not micro) SIM card which may be a troublesome task to get due to long queues at service stores and especially so if you are do not have a spare/second SIM/number3. Battery drain is quite fast while you are using camera or watching videos and it does get heated up after a while of heavy usage4. If you are switching from android, be prepared for the frustration that comes with finding out a way to transfer your contacts5. Apps - notification system and actual apps uses different ways to fetch the data so apps like gmail or whatsapp will show you notifications but it will take a while for you to get the message on your app once you open it6. Left side of the In-built speakers at the bottom of the phone is useless, if you cover the right side the phone will go silent. Check this out on youtube if you like.Despite all of this, its a phone worth going for. I received the delivery in 3 days which was okay for me.",1.0

"At first, I was a bit apprehensive of buying a product this expensive from online. But after it got delivered and using it for 5 days, I am happy about my decision of buying from Amazon and secondly going for the best smartphone in the market.My first moment of truth was with the delivery time, the courier was delivered two days ahead that too in Cochin. Second is with the quality and the usability aspect of iPhone 5S.The best thing I love with iPhone 5S are:- The simplicity of the user interface.- The super smooth response. I was taken away by how fast the iOS 7 responded, even though more than a dozen applications where running in the background; to name a few - Viber, WhatsApp, Google Chrome, Mail, Safari, Facebook, Twitter, iCloud backup and many more- Build quality is superb, with the metal casing. I would say, one should feel it yourself by holding it in your hand- The size of the phone is well balanced, its neither too big to fit in my palm nor too small when it comes to screen size; moreover, it fits well in my shirts and trousers pocket.- When it comes to security, iPhone stands out from the crowd. This stems from the fact that, Apple's iPhone and iPad have the widest adoption in the enterprise. For me this is all about peace of mind, as I don't have to think twice before installing an App.- Biometric authentication, a nifty feature which I love the most. Now, I no longer need to memorize unlock codes nor patters to unlock the phone. With this, unlocking the device and making purchases from App store is a breeze, by pressing the finger on the home button.The features I wished to have with iPhone are:- An elegant way to migrate contacts, calendars, notes, reminder and data from other models. It was an ordeal for me getting the data migrated from old phone.- Battery backup could have been made better, while 3G is on. For me it lasts only up to 8 to 9 hrsFor me, initially iPhone 5S wasn't on my radar, predominantly because of its heavy price tag. But with the launch of iPhone 6, prices have come down to a level, which is affordable enough for those looking in the 30K - 40K price range.Anyhow thanks to Amazon and ""Lion Deals"" for the great online shopping experience.",1.0

I am giving 'three star' as the phone had troubled me within 10 days of my purchase from amazon.

"I was trying to find an option to give negative stars to this seller. I have been using iPhone for 3 years now. I uses iPhone 6 and 5s but I had bought it from Croma and E Zone. For some reasons I had to sell it. The when I thought of buying it again I saw this iPhone 5s on Amazon for Rs 17,800.00. After consulting with people who ordered phones online I ordered it from Amazon.Trust me, I can make a list of faults I found in this phone. Soon as i received the order, the box of iPhone looked different. The box colour was faded. The font of the text looked different than how usually it is. After opening the box I took the phone in me hands and it was lighter in weight than usual. The pin that we get with it to open the SIM slot was broken. The scren resolution was dull. And now the software and apps states to freeze.The bottom line was Amazon sold a fake iPhone to me and now I'm fighting a battle with them to get a refund. Cuz I'm sure if I go for a replacement the other phone that they will provide me will be fake as well.",0.0

"Genuine Apple iPhone 5S: I was worried about receiving a duplicate iPhone or refurbished one as none of the online sellers are listed on Apple India Website as the authorized re sellers. I am happy with my decision and received a Nov 2015 imported model. It is new, original, unused and not refurbished.Delivery Experience: I paid Rs. 120 extra to receive it by 11am next day as I placed the order around 2PM. I received it at 10am the next day.Warranty: I checked the warranty on Apple website & it is valid for 1 year from the date I received it.Price: I called up authorized resellers & it was being offered at Rs. 26,500 against the Rs. 23,800 that I paid at Amazon. Personally, I trust Amazon more than I trust the so called authorized resellers. I was also able to convert the amount into EMI on Amazon website while checking out. It will get charged to my credit card over 6 months. That is very helpful.5S or 6: I have been using 5.5"" phones like Samsung Galaxy S3 and Moto G3 and one of the key attractions of iPhone 5S for me was the smaller size. It is far more convenient to hold in your hand, carry in your pocket and pretty awesome in every way. I agree with Steve Jobs on this one and I do not appreciate the size of the iPhone 6 variants as launched by Mr. Tim Cook.iOS vs Android: If you have ever driven a Maruti/Hyundai and then moved up to a VW/Fiat/Audi, well the experience is pretty much the same. the entire user experience is far more seamless and refined. Things like iCloud Drive come at a price unlike the free Google Drive. I was able to connect the Bluetooth to my Car's integrated system and download my phone book, make hands free calls etc. I just added my Gmail account and since all my contact were there, I now have them on my iPhone. Absolutely no complications at all during the set up. Most large corporations are now blocking work email access on Androids and your options are limited to i Phones & Windows Phones. Go for a Windows phone if your budget is under 10K. Else, pick this one up. There are several security vulnerabilities in Android that are coming to light recently. Stage Fright is just one of them. Also, there are concerns over Google selling/mining user data (Contacts, Gmail, Search History, Photos & everything) whereas Apple has a long standing reputation for protecting your privacy.At this price (20-23K), go ahead and pick up the most sought after iPhone that is available today. You owe it to yourself! they may never make it in the correct size again.",1.0

Well I don't feel one need to even utter a word about iPhone 5s. The name itself speaks for itself. Its been nearly 2 months that I had been using this phone and believe me people there is not single sign of lag or heating even with more than 7 apps running in the background.

But considering the price at which it is trading right now IT is the BEST BUY.About the seller the product is 100% genuine. I had even checked the warranty status on the apple self solve website. Thanks for such a nice experience.,1.0

This phone believe me was an awesome phone and will overcome all ur expectations. I was confused tht i should buy this since iphone 6 was out but decided to go for 5s since i dont like the iphone 6 very much. Iphone 6 belive its not look like an apple flagship phone. I was really happy with iphone 5s. If u want an apple phone then 5s will make ur dream come true!!,1.0
Awesome product....received today....Even though I have not gone thru the phone fully... I can say...yummy...yummy...Iphone rocks...Thanks Amazon. Thanks Seller... U made me my day....Good Sealed packed product and great in use for the first time. Let me go through in details and leave the feedback for my amazon buddies......................,1.0
"This is a genuine product and comes with 1 year OEM warranty (check with nearby Apple service center).No COD on this product but the delivery was prompt and product arrived in good condition.About Iphone 5S in general: value for money at the price I bought (though I suspect prices will go down further). Differences with iphone 6 are marginal at the best and are probably meant for more discerning users. The 4 inch screen would appeal to those who want great performance and a ""managable"" phone size.Also, you would get auto upgraded to IOS 9.2  during setup. For people moving from Android, there is cool feature which allows seamless transfer of most of the data from old phone to your new iphone.Satisfied on almost all counts till now.",1.0
Its not even 2 month now and the phone is not working.First voice quality was bad from the beginning but i ignored for few days.Later If I turned on the loudspeaker the other side can't hear me and now I can't even turn it on.I am sure it was defective piece sent by Amazon.,0.0

"Its my first iPhone and second Apple device.

A very good phone and most importantly handy . can be used with a single hand and doesnt just completely encroach your pocket .

I have been using this phone since 1 month and now I'm gonna update my views about this product. However the product delivery was fine (One day late) and got original iPhone from Apple. I selected this product over iPhone 6 because personally I don't like the design of iPhone 6 or 6S and this iPhone have great design. I got the fresh iPhone 5S Silver but I guess my phone has an issue. My iPhone got heated when I go outside in this summer and during the charge of phone it get overheated.  So that's only the issue that I'm facing other wise it is superb phone. Below I'm gonna mention some Pros and Cons for your knowledge.PROS:1] Doesn't hang2] Looks Stylish3] You will get frequent upgrades of iOS (I updated it to iOS 9.3.1 from iOS 9.2.1) compare to Android.4] Camera Quality is Superb (Front and Rear)5] You can make Slow Motion Video (I loved it)6] Sound quality can beat any Android phone7] Fingerprint Scanner works smoothly8] Health Monitor tracks your activities9] Earphone design looks awesome and it's quality tooCONS:1] Heating Issue (My iPhone get heated during charging and when I go outside in this summer. I don't know if you get can get a piece with no heating issue. Because I have seen it is a one of common problem in iPhone)2] Shots in flash may not seem good3] Limited and Paid Application,1.0
I ordered this on a friday and the phone was delivered to me on Saturday! The service was superb.

"I used different android mobiles before I made my mind to shift to iPhone.Every android i used had the similar issue, either hanging or battery heating or, app crash.. Continues app updates that was also annoying. If u get good battery then it lacks good hardware..and vice versa... My relative asked me to give it a try..as we hear..one who has used iPhone never go for other mobile thenafter. So I bought it.The phone is really a masterpiece. But there are some restrictions also.Good thing is that it never hangs..i mean till date I did not experienced such issue, the phone doesn't heat much...it heats up only while charging and that's a normal thing as it is due to the lightning charging (similar to turbo charging)Other than this i do not have any isseYes about restrictions. U can not put songs directly to the memory of phone, u need itunes installed in pc by which u cn sync ur favourite songs movie or video, but it is again complicated if u r not a tech savvy. U can not share music of movies or private album directly or via whatsapp... Cz iphone follows copyright rules.and also it wants u to purchase music via itunes.The camera quality is the best compared to any other mobile phone present in its budget range. All the app are good, the ram works fine, i did not faces any issue of app crashI also loved the iMessage service by which u can send mms via data or wifi apple to apple free.The phone lacks notification light.Also remember it has 1630mAh battery i think. But yes it gives 10 hours yes exact 10 hours of talktime. You can keep talking tge whole night the phone wont go down. No background running app using its ram and battery. And cz of this ur cellular data is also consumed less.U will need time to love it.Ohh yes one more thing although I am loving this phone for the positive reasons mentioned above, but still..

"I have received my 5s on Apr'16 and after i use the mobile for 2 months I am in the comfort stage to comment, Iniutialy, the battery was draining a lot, and then i upgraded the version in Apple service centre. Ha glad to say, it was working fine now N I just love the touch speed and I am really very comfortable using it... Finger touch open, Siri are the exclusive Apple catch ???? Very handy mobile compared to 6, 6s or 6s+.. Next heating problem, Apple finish will surely have heating problem if you use for long time. What is suggest is use the mobile case to avoid heat. I am using Rock Royce case which is really perfect and avoid the heating problem, good looking as well.Camera is the another key thing Apple give it to their customers... Best camera features, clarity... The only thing I hate is that it always remind us to upgrade the latest version. Otherwise, Thanks Amazon for always giving the best price and delivering the product before the expected date. ????",1.0
"I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 4 without adding bulk. The iPhone 5s fit the bill perfectly. The phone I received was brand new (Manufacture and import date June 2016) and sealed (matched the numbers on the phone and the pack and checked on the Apple website). Amazon delivered it in a day (thanks to Prime) despite heavy rain. The first thing I noticed was how light this phone is in comparison to the iPhone 4. It fits in the pocket quite easily. It was already running iOS 9.2 and I could easily configure my existing Apple ID. There are some really nice additions such as Touch ID and the health app (which tracks the number of steps you walk in a day). The call quality and 4G speed (using the Airtel 4G sim) are superb, as is the camera. I'm using a black Spigen case, which looks really cool.PS: I purchased it from the seller TigeRetaiL.",1.0

"This review is for Indian buyers. I won't go into the pros and cons of the device. However, as someone whose iPhone fell down, resulting in a broken screen - Beware ! Apple India does not allow part repair for screens - guess why? Because the Indian technicians are not trained enough !! Yes - that is the reason I got from the Apple Care Helpline.As a result while the rest of the world pays 109 dollars - about 7K from a new screen - Indians have to pay a whopping 25K minimum - no other options. Why minimum - because of phone has any other damage- the price goes up. However, on my insistence, the Apple care lady admitted that you could try having it serviced in another country where they do part repair - but no guarantees. There is no option to courier the device and have it repaired abroad either.To be forced to pay more than 50% of the cost of the phone for something than happens frequently with kids and slips from car dashboards, and especially considering the slippery iPhone screen and protruding camera slot in the back is nothing short of robbery. I would not have bought the phone had I seen this information",0.0

"My friend bought this handset last week and i must say it is a performance monster. As a developer i can say why ?01. First the OS and all apps are written in C/C++ which makes it very efficient. What it does in 1 GB, Android takes 3 GB to do.02. Hence with the launch of Apple 7, this is still value for money.03. Camera is also very very good.

Being an average user i can easilymanage to get through a day with say 15-20% battery still remaining.I know this phone myt b obsolete and there is an option of an 6/6s, but i always felt a 4"" phone is the best what fits in my palm perfectly and what more could i have wished other than a iPhone 5s.Final Verdict:It was a great experience, to shop @Amazon, hope to continue it further.Thanku Amazon!",1.0

The seller was gabbardeals .Now about the iPhone 5s its the best in term of simplicity and class .the build quality is solid i would say only htc m8 can be compare when it comes to build quality .the colour saturation is of the best unlike samsung amoled display which are over saturated .about the camera 9/10 build 9/10 call quality 9/10 speed 10/10 no lag at all iOS 7 is good and very fluidic and clean and intuitive .I'm telling this on my experience with the phone so any one who would like to buy the iPhone don't hesitate just get it and then you feel it .I'm very satisfied with my new iPhone 5s space grey and now eagerly waiting for iOS 8 .,1.0

"This review is going to be a long one so please have some patience. First of all those who are worrying if the phones are fake, it is a genuine piece. i also got  1 year apple warranty and also checked it on the apple website. I will also be discussing if the phone is worth in 2016. So lets get into the review.DESIGN: One of the most premium phones out there. really good build quality. Very solid build and the quality of build is also great. One of the best designs of a smartphone. The build quality is on par with flagships of this day. so no problems there.SCREEN: One of the most controversial things one iphone is the screen. People say it not even a hd screen and its pixel density is only 326ppi compared to other 1080p displays which give about 441ppi. First of all let me tell you one thing. Once you cross a certain ppi limit it is impossible to distinguish the pixels. So even if you get higher pixel count you wont notice the difference. The screen of the phone is very sharp and i never felt the screen lacks sharpness. Yes, if you take the iphone and put it side by side with a full hd phone there is a small difference in sharpness but when you use them seperately you cannot see the difference. A slightly higher resolution would have been nice but nonetheless the screen is sharp and great. So you dont need to bother about the resolution( samsung gives uhd display which is purely a gimmick as anything above full hd display you wont be able to tell the difference on small screens. and people are like ooooh uhd screen but they fail to see it doesnt matter on small mobile phone screens). And the lower resolution also gives better graphics prerformace and better battery life. But as i said the 326 ppi is very sharp and good enough. The viewing angles are very good and the color accuracy is great. The brightness is also very good at full birightness. And about the 4 inch display. Its smaller than android phones but i prefer the 4 inch phone as i like a phone which i can access all 4 corners with one hand. So it just comes down to preference. It feels nice to hold the entire phone in one hand.BATTERY: The battery life is average. I get about 4-5 hours of screen on time on moderate usage which translates to about 1 days of normal usage. On low power mode you will get about 5-6 hours of screen on time on moderate usage. So battery life is average-good. It also charges very fast.HEATING: First of all remember that the body of the phone is made of metal which conducts heat. So it will be a little warmer than other phones with plastic bodies for the same amount of usage. The phone becomes warm(not hot)  when charging and sometimes when using normally it does become warm (once again not hot). When playing games it does get hot but not unbearable or anything. So no abnormal heating or anything.CAMERA: The camera is really good on the phone. Yes the phone is old but still takes great pictures. The shutter speed is amazing. The video captures is also great. Dont expect the quality of pictures to be on par with todays flagships. But still its capable of taking great pictures and videos. Low light pictures are also very good.STORAGE: I got a 16gb version out of which 11.3gb is free. i usually dont store many media or apps on my phone so storage is not a problem for me but an expandable storage would have been nice. Apple seriously needs to think about it.USABILITY: I agree the ios doesnt have the same level of customizability as android but i really like the ui of ios. I never felt i need a launcher or a new skin on top of the ios. The overall ui transitions are really nice and smooth. I also like the in app ui for apps on ios. Ios is always known for its simplicity and i agree. The phone is easy and very nice to use.DATA TRANSFER: One of the problem with ios is data transfer. In the past we always had to connect to pc and connect to itunes to transfer data. But now we have shareit app which allows us to transfer music,videos,pictures and pdfs to iphone from pc or other android or windows devices. There is also apps in windows like 'ifunbox' which you can download and access the file system of the iphone directly. So the problem of data transfer is also reduced compared to in the past. Its still not as easy as android but still you can transfer data without much fuss. But an OTG support would have been nice. Apple also need to consider this.SOUND: The sound from the in call speaker is very clear and loud.  No problems there. The loud speaker is loud but not very loud.There are some other phones which have louder speakers but still the loudness is good enough  but whats great about the speakers is that the sound quality even at the highest volume is very good where as on other phones which have louder speakers the sound gets a little distorted and quality is not as good as the iphone speakers at full volume. But the iphone speakers are loud enough. No need to worry about that.PERFORMANCE: The apple A7 chip in the phone is the first 64-bit processor. The performance from the phone is amazing considering it is a 2 and half year old phone. All the apps get demolished by the processor. Even the most demanding games like real racing 3, and nova 3, are handled smoothly by the phone. And the phone will be good for at least another 2 years or even more. Yes the A9 chip in the iphone 6s and the 5se is very powerful but the A7 chips is still good and can handle all the apps thrown at it. Even multitasking is smooth.Even though A9 chip and the A8 chips are more powerful the A7 chip is good enough to handle everyday tasks and gaming and multitasking.PRICE: I got the phone for Rs.20000. I always hate apple for pricing their products ridiculously high. But for the price of 20k. its a good deal.P.S: As soon as you get the phone upgrade to ios9.3 as the phone becomes smoother on ios9.3. The phone comes with ios9.2.1 on which the ui stutters sometimes. But ios9.3 fixes this and the ui becomes smooth. You may see stutter on ios9.3 but its very rare. So not a problem.So overall its a great phone and still worth getting even in 2016.",1.0

"It was shocking that Apple Iphone 5S sold over this Portal by vendors are associated with high risk and more Quality issues. The phone has got delivered with loosely connected rear camera say manufacturing defect.  It was occasionally turning into blue, pink, blank and blurr.Apple firmware 8.1 is a bad one for iphone 5S and do not upgrade. I noticed it in internet.  It appears that Amazon is not having any quality measures in place for the sealed objects sold.However It is Amazons primary responsibility that while choosing a product to list in its site should ensure to have a after sales support and service in the demography dealt in.Apple India is saying there is hard way to do service in india as they do not have any direct retail sales or support center. They could help if there is any issue on any portal purchase.I have got a written direct to return the phone to Amazon or the cellular carrier from whom it is purchased.",0.0

"I have been a long time android user and an android fan. However having an iPhone fascinated me. I always wanted to have one but could not due to one reason or the other. Finally, the price of the iPhone 5S has come down to something which I can afford.I ordered this phone from Amazon on 9th Sep and got it delivered to me by 11th Sep. The packaging by Amazon is simply awesome and the product just as you would expect to be. I setup the phone by following a number of quick steps. Once setup I started using it I fell in love with this phone more than ever. I have used a Nexus 5 and compared to the hardware on Nexus 5 although the hardware in iPhone sound a bit outdated but that's not the case. The performance of iPhone 5 is very close to the Nexus 5. Even the battery life is comparable to a 2000+ MAH battery android phones available in the market. Processing speeds are good, there is is no lag. Gaming, Movie Watching & other multimedia things you do on a normal phone are simply a pleasure on this phone.In the nutshell, its worth a change / upgrade if you are Android user and if you are already an iOS user then i dont have to exaggerate more about the iPhone.",1.0

I purchased the iphone 5s from Amazon India on Diwali but the item I received was a defective one with there is some loose thud sound coming when we shake the phone.

"Best phone in the market, Its design, music quality, highest resolution screen, camera, 64 bit architecture, finger print sensor are just remarkable. Its lightweight and easy to use, It never hang. Using this phone, truly understand that Apple does not compromise with quality. People who complain about battery, turn off unnecessary location services of apps you don't use, Battery will last much longer. Android users just dying to prove them, but just because both reach to same destination one can't have comparison between Jaguar and Maruti suzuki.

"I have ordered an iphone 5s 16GB on 28th Jan,15. I received this product on 3rd feb,15 It has been just 3 days that i have been using the phone but the performance has been very disappointing !!I had such a bad experience that i would never like to order from this website and will never ever recommend anyone to order from amazon.in if that is the poor quality the website has to deliver!!!!I had a lot of problems in this phone in only three days:1. The phone restarts on its own. It got switched OFF on its own and i could not switch it ON for 20 mins . I put it on charging , tried again but again it failed starting!!! later after a while it got switched ON on its own..2. This whole process of the phone getting ON and OFF repeated 3-4 times the very next day!!!3. After restarting my phone , the touch ID was not working at all!! i tried setting it up again but the setup failed and i cannot set it up since then!!!4.Calling somebody from this ruthless phone is again a havoc . I mean calling at least should be fine which is the basic requirement in a phone.  Calling is done very slow, the dial pad comes late after the call starts. when i pickup any call, i am able to hear the other person a little late (as i mentioned that the dial pad comes late) .I wonder if that is the performance of the phone in only 3 days, then what all number of problems will it give in months and years!!Honestly, I felt that amazon has fooled me with an old phone or not a genuine one because that is not the quality provided by such a reputed company that is Apple and its iPhones!!this not only brings down what people think of amazon but amazon is making bad mark for Apple too!!!the return policy with amazon does not include a replacement or an exchange procedure which is yet again a disappointment!!I would recommend people not get befooled with the deals or discounts provided by amazon because they are not delivering quality products in the name of deals and heavy discounts. I am sorry but that is what is the experience says with amazon which is not at all accepted.I hope amazon will look into this matter and make the necessary changes so as to live it up with the customer needs!!Name: Srishti Anejae mail : anejasrishti@gmail.com",0.0

"Important thing is the product was delivered within 48 hours of placing the order. The seller (PrimeRetail) was very prompt in delivery and very good packaging. As it is a ""Fulfilled By Amazon"" seller, no need of any second thoughts about the seller or packaging.Coming to the phone, the product is genuine and you can check in the Apple website as well if required.The look and feel is exceptional and the battery back up is pretty good. Lasts around 1 day and half for normal usage including 2G and WiFi data.The phone is quite quick to charge courtesy the lightning cable provided. It takes less than 1 hour for the phone to become fully charged to 100%.Overall very much satisfied with the phone. If there are doubts as this model is almost 2 years old, don't have any as iPhone 5s is on par with OnePlus One when it comes to performance. No amount of lags whatsoever.For those who have had enough of Android phones and are looking for something different, then this is your best bet. Go for it without hesitations.Update : Recently took a 4g connection and there is no heating issues whatsoever. The connection is quite fast and I have stopped using a WiFi after that. So not much battery drain as iOS has been optimized well for 4g.",1.0
"I bought 5s on 24th dec 15 through Amazon.in. As usual, got a brand new genuine product (verified on apple service center & apple website) before the committed date.

"Pros:Great phone.Flawless .works smooth and touch is also very fluid.IOS 9.2 comes out of the box that makes the Phone come alive.The camera is awesome compared to the competitors, don't get fooled by the lower pixels even the front cam takes sharp vibrant images.The product was manufactured and imported in December 2015.Factory unlocked .Registered it after opening the box have one year of apple warranty.Accessories are good , I guess I got the 10w charger which was supplied with iPad.Cons:Just an issue which most of Indian user may experience.During charging if u place the phone upside down and rub the aluminum back you will feel a gentle vibration.I don't think that's an big issue as i think its due to the improper grounding and so.Will update after using it a month.Great switch from android to ios..

Came back updated to ios 9.3 ohh s*** it become more worse, hit to apple service centre, they said my ios was corrupted. They put a fresh one,now its working good but still having some heating issues in 4g.

"Since I've been an Android since the last few years, my experience with the iPhone don't go down too well for the first couple of weeks at least. The only thing Apple products have over others is the looks and the feel. obviously iPhone's looks and feel is unparalleled. But if could do it again i would have gone for an Android. Android is just so much easier. iPhone is too restrictive. The iTunes software is just a total deal breaker. Having to connect the phone to the laptop to grant access to many of the apps is just painful. Can't edit anything on the phone, can't create folders on the go, the phone's video player is crappy, can't cut calls, just way too many problems which i never came across on other Androids. So i suggest you go for an Android, unless u have to <20k for this. That's a deal i would take any day.There is a new trend of amazon delivery guys claiming their card swiping machines don't work and that they only accept cash, which is fine as long as they return the exact change but they don't. I know it's just a matter of 6-7 rupees but that's not the point. I had to go withdraw a huge sum from the ATM, which was obviously a pain in the neck.I hope amazon looks into this.",0.0

"From a distance, the iPhone 5S looks almost like a replica of the iPhone 5. This is both a good, as well as a bad thing, depending on what you're seeking. If you're happy with the compact form factor of the iPhone 5, then you have a reason to cheer since most high-end flagships come with big screens and often sacrifice ergonomics and usability. However, if you're someone looking for a big display, you're in for repeated disappointment. I feel the display is still the best in its class offering excellent brightness, wide viewing angles, and under-sun legibility. Images and text look crisp and sharp, and if you're happy with the screen size, you don't really have much to complain about.The Home button, which is the only key on the front, is located just below the display, but sports a silver ring around it. It's one of the few visible changes that you'd see in the iPhone 5S. Its purpose is much more than being a cosmetic enhancement. It is part of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor which is integrated with the Home button and offers an alternative way of securing the phone.The iPhone 5S is the first widely available smartphone to be powered by a chip that features 64-bit architecture. Apple also claims that its A7 chip delivers CPU and graphics performance up to two times faster than its predecessor. the speed bump is not related to the processor being 64-bit. Though it lays the foundation of the future; the 64-bit architecture will help in better memory management and will work in tandem with apps optimized for it as they're made available. It also supports OpenGL ES 3.0 standard for enhanced graphics performance especially while playing 3D games.The phone charges really quick, so if you do carry a charger, you can re-energize your iPhone in a jiffy. While Apple already offers a 4 digit passcode lock to protect the iPhone, the Touch ID offers a simple, yet effective way to authenticate the phone for unlocking it, or while purchasing content from the App Store and iTunes Store.It's worth pointing out that you'll still need to set-up a pass code and verify at at certain times, in addition to verifying the biometric fingerprint.Up to five impressions of fingers (including thumbs) can be added. This means that you can also add finger impressions of different individuals, in case more than one person uses the phone.The camera on the iPhone 5S offers a 15% larger sensor, bigger pixels and an f/2.2 aperture to allow more light to come in. The improved optics result in much better low-light pictures compared to the ones shot with an iPhone 5. The level of noise and distortion while capturing lit objects in low-light conditions, is much lower in pictures taken with the iPhone 5S. We also found colour reproduction to be more accurate, and white balance to be in perfect harmony, thanks to the new image signal processor, part of the phone's A7 chip.Having said that, even if you're not an iOS user but want to invest in a device that will last you more than an year (even two years), receive regular software updates, deliver a consistent camera and stable software experience, and offer a premium yet solid look and feel, then we'd recommend the iPhone 5S.Other Great Features1. Slow Motion Camera works Great2. Hyperlaps video3. Facetime and iMessage that are free to use.4. One year india warranty and genuine5. battery works for 15 hrs approx. I charge my phone twice in 25 hrs as i am hooked on to it a lot with Wifi/3G.6. Best when used with 3G.You can go ahead to buy this phone as the prices are less now after iPhone 6 launch. Do like review to help others.",1.0
"Dear Sir,I, Arijit Banerjee have purchased iPhone 5s 16 GB gold (serial no. 359269063316424) from amazon.in on 26th September 2015 and the bill no. was (rg- HYD7-152525641-53681).

Display LCI paper missing It's seriously annoying that I have received a defected product from amazon.in.  Amazon India has cheated me with a product which is having a manufacturing defect. I would also like to inform you that being a most premium brand like Apple doesn't have the quality check for each device. I have given the phone to the service centre and as per their norms I have to wait for 3 ' days to know what has to be done with the device. If any handling damage found I should consider but whereas the problem was detected is a manufacturing defect. I am also attaching the Service report that I have received.

The apps are wonderful especially with the new Health App. The best part of Amazon is the speed and prompt delivery. I received my package within 24 hours of my order online. I recommend this phone for people who just want to have a best one in a small size.,1.0

Seller is amazing - of course because they work with amazon. Again the right combination i see... Price is tooo high but i would pay the amount where its not compromised in the product or the seller service quality.",1.0

"Apple is India is just making money. Quality is pathetic. Looks Great. Two of my Apple products were defective and currently i have an defective iPhone 5S. Are they shipping seconds in Asia ?Apple Iphone cannot stand moisture, sweat. It will trigger some paper inside which supposedly is to be triggered by waste/liquid. They don't cover under warranty. They will claim that the customer is at fault. I am trying to prove my point with Apple India. If i do not get favorable response. I will post pic and data to show that this is a strategy by apple to void warranty without proper justification. Cant they go for a technology to stop moisture/sweat  from entering their phones  ?  It is not to be used by humans but to be kept in showcase.Apple had gone for out of court settlement in  USA for the same issue in 2013. Lets see how they respond in India.Make a logical and well informed call. Don't go by heart ....It will break yours.

"timely delivery. happy with that. always have been waiting to own an apple product. and since the amazon is a trustworthy site, i have chose amazon to place my order. Like i was waiting long enough to own one, i was happy to recieve the package as per ordered.the problem started when i started using it. since the first month itself i had a problem with the device getting over heated. so heated up that u can barely even hold it close to your ears. and this occurs for just normal operations. during making calls or browsing. i did not download any movies or music in it.its been almost 5 months now since i have bought this product. the screen on top right corner is popping out. even if i press it wont stay back in there. it pops out again.  ""AMAZON"" PLEASE HELP ME OUT WITH THIS PROBLEM.",0.0
"I am not a blind Apple fan and prefer Android (HTC Phones). This is my second iPhone This time around I am liking iPhone a bit more.

Amazon's delivery was prompt and price(Rs.41,000) was sweet. So overall a satisfactory buy.",1.0

"Received FAULTY product two consecutive times. Voice of the caller is BARELY AUDIBLE. MIC of the phone DOES NOT work when phone is in speaker mode. Such a big brand with poor quality check is highly disappointing. Also, Looks like the seller has all the Defective Items/Returned Items in its warehouse to be sold off to customers. Even more disappointing is the fact that Amazon, being such a big name in the market, allows such sub-standard Sellers on its website in a world where there is so much of competition from other big names. It was my first order for an Electronic Item from Amazon and it turned out to be the worst experience. Will never purchase a product from this Seller and will have to think 1000 times before placing an order for electronic item from Amazon",0.0

So the persons who reviewed some negative may be have a defective piece. So you can have trust to buy this one.,1.0

"I have not bought this from Amazon so this review is not on price or for Amazon service but for the product itself. If you get it under 30k then i will say its a good buy in that price because you get Excellent Hardware and software combination. I have been using iPhones from past 5 years and have used iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and now 5S. This one has been best of the lot. Its sleek , has an excellent Camera which takes decent pictures in low light. Low light photography was an issue before iPhone 5S. I have loaded 5 Gb of apps on this device and it has never slowed down. Never had any issues while playing graphics heavy games. If you are one who looks at specification too much you may say other phones have better config and are cheaper then you deserve that phone please go buy it but if you want how a phone performs in hand then it beats most phones of its class. Has a very handy finger scanning feature which helps when you have to unlock your phone so many times in the age of Whatsapp and social media. It can also be used to make purchases and it works like a charm. So overall if you not willing to shell 48-75k for iphone 6/6 plus then this is the best iPhone out there",1.0

iPhone 5s gold is just golden beauty. Perhaps the best smart phone available in the market. Feels so good in your hand and looks premium. It's worth every rupee you pay. I m not going to talk about the technical thing here as many are aware of it. I used to hate apple iPhone but now I am full fan of this beauty. This is my first purchase from Amazon and it's truly amazing delivery and I got my phone within 24hrs. Welcome change for me from big Samsung phones. It's been close to month I have been using this phone and I have not faced any issues till now. I will never ever go for Samsung again and battery sucks big time. I am really amazed to see the features of iPhone.. Beautiful camera and well designed phone. I strongly recommend to buy this golden beauty .,1.0

"Apple I Phones are either hyped or the sets sold in India are of poor quality. My one month old 5S phone goes on silent on its own ( five times till date) .I had to first waist time to locate customer care number which should be easily available. On contacting Apple Technical Team India, Delhi, a hard boot operation was performed on the advice. After it failed to alleviate the problem, I was asked to take it to the workshop.Sadly, even the Apple Team India is not clear on the procedure which will be followed for repair/ replacement. Why should a customer be harassed and made to run around after spendiing so much money on the phone? Intriguingly Apple launched OS8 when it still had bugs. I do not understand what are these gadget gurus raving about it. Let us join hands and expose the much hyped Apple's inferior products till they get up and take notice of customers in India. If it was in the US the buyer would have sued apple for compensation for the loss of time and stress.Hope someone from Apple who is senior enough to take decisions will wake and give me a call to hear my view point. My details are with amazon.",0.0

"I was an android guy all this while, finally switched over to an iPhone. The iPhone 5s is still an lovely phone. Does its job extremely well and is a joy to use. Processor speeds and ram etc are a thing of the past and just marketing jargon. 1gb ram on this baby and she does not skip a page. That's design and efficiency in perfect harmony. One handed use of a phone is critical. Trust me I've owned a note a nexus etc. this screen size works brilliantly. That's where the iPhone 6 lost out for me and I have big hands. A 4"" iPhone 6 and I will consider it. At this price nothing comes close.The seller was prompt in delivery. Arrived in a day an packed well. The warranty is valid. Over a good experience.",1.0

"I ordered this phone last week and it got delivered to me withing two days. Product was well packed and 100% genuine (checked its serial no before opening it). I've been using android os for the past 3 years and trust me ios beats android in every aspect that too by a far greater margin. Coming to the device, right from its physical appearance to performance its totally worth the amount. Camera might be 8 mp but its much better than its counterpartrs who offer around 20 mp these days.There is so much to play with the camera with options such as slo-motion, time-lapse, etc. Even the shots taken during low or dim light will leave you wondering. At last, just go for this beautiful device and you'll not regret the decision. My 5 stars to amazon and Iphone.",1.0

"I am fortunate to get iPhone 5S Gold 16GB at an unbelievable discounted price of Rs. 29999 !The pack that I received was in immaculate original condition. The phone is working perfectly.There is no need of explaining about this highly appreciated phone.I personally feel like out of all the iPhone models released until now including recent iPhone 6, there is no comparison on the build quality and finesse like the iPhone 5S. This model is a keeper for long long time.I have made the order on 6th evening and received the pack on 8th afternoon. Hats off to Amazon for not hyping too much like the other e-retailers are doing and for the genuine claims as can be seen on their website.",1.0

"Don't purchase this Phone. I have purchased this phone in April,2016 and it has lasted only for 4 months. The screen is running automatically and i have contacted Apple support and also visited Apple store. They have told me it is not covered in the warranty period. I have contacted amazon also and there is no response from their side. The phone is now ready for Dustbin.There is no single damage in the phone. I have lost all the interest in the I phone. It's worst than NOKIA, HTC and Samsung what I have used earlier.Apple iPhone 5s (Space Grey, 16GB)",0.0

"Hello Amazon,  It's surprising to see the price of I phone 5s 32gb is so high, where apple has cut down the price to 49k....but still you want to sell it for a grand 62k....and the glad part is  price is marginally lesser than flipkart....you mention that you are waving off 35% discount on iPhone 5s 16.gb..priced at 35k.. how can u say that it's a 35% discount when the actual price is only 44k....try to update your system and change the price details accordingly.. you guys are doing pretty good..big fan",0.0

"The phone is amazing. However, I'm experiencing extreme rates of call failure, due to which battery life is also getting affected. What's funny is that the phone is showing full signal strength, yet most outgoing calls fail and most incoming calls fail too. Calls only work when I turn 3G on (Weird) which is a dampner because that again affects battery life. Battery life has been poor because of this.Also, while Amazon's delivery was on time, the packaging could've been miles better.(No bubblewrap was used, only a card board box)Update: Found a way to toggle back to 2G network.

Bought from them many times even before.This phone is amazing. Best phone ever. For 17500 I could not have expected a better quality of phone. I agree there are better RAM, memory, etc available but believe me this is more than enough.I charge phone at night and, in Mumbai with fluctuating range, battery is at 62% at 9 pm. Do I care if it is just 1500mAh?Phone never hangs. And no limit to multitasking.  It doesnt matter if it is not 2GB or 3 GB.Display is awesome. Camera fantastic. Screen size takes time to get used to. But believe me no complains.Remember this phone people were lining up to buy for 40-45 thousand rupees. This 17500 is great!!!Better this phone than useless Chinese companies which dont even last a year ( my Xiaomi). Better this phone than expensive phones worth my monthly salary.",1.0

"Using the phone last 7 days and found that -1. Little Heavy, Mobile should light weighted. Those days gone when bulky phone is good.2. Outdated  - Think this is the model of 2010 when no one make touch screen and no one have those facility but now a days if you spend 20-30K you will get far better and Larger screen phone with all the features.3. Battery  - Again 2010 funda. Daily charge or 8 hr use is outdated now .4. Camara - 8 MP when now u can get 13 to 20 MP in front and Front 5 MP. One thing should remember dont mix with 10k phone price camara. You can't compare COW vs Dog. Compare with  Moto G, Lumia 730 atleast.But..... the plus point is........1. Elite look. People think I phone means it used by Elite class. Like Blackberry used from 2005 to 2012 but now no one use Blackberry.2. Fit to pocket and Hand. Again think 4 inch is very small now.Why maintenance is tooooo much costly. When u visit store for maintenance after warranty you are finished !!!App - this is the best part, All the app is good. Like or Better then Android , No one beat in this section. Android is add and fake application but Apple does not the same.despondent................... but this is true !!regards,",1.0
The Phone was received in time and was sealed packed and genuine.The 5S is very light compared to its previous models and has a very fast processor.The camera is also much advanced and u can increase the brightness of the picture while taking a pic.The best feature is the finger print lock .Amazon service has always been excellent as usual.,1.0

Hello friends...I had buyed iphone 5s in september 2014 at lower price of ? 31000/- ( iphone showroom prices 49000/- at that time). Till today i have no problem. I m so happy with AMAZON.,1.0
"I ordered my Apple iPhone 5s Silver 16GB on Christmas day i.e. 25th Dec 2015 at 3:30 PM. I applied for the 1-day delivery at the checkout and sealed the deal. To my amazement, I received the phone in Delhi properly sealed and in a great packaged condition at 4:30 PM the next day. That was really very swift from both the seller and the delivery people. Received my phone in dot 25 hours was indeed impressive. Now coming to the iPhone, let me reiterate that it is an amazing machine and here is a fun fact. It was the last Apple device Steve Jobs worked on. And we can see for ourselves how badly iPhone 6 and 6s have fared. The 4-inch screen is a bliss and the grip on the hand is great. Even the pocket feels nice and easy when the iPhone is in it. Not like the bulky brick sized plus editions. Now coming to the battery. I got a Nov 2015 phone. Thats means I received a new iPad like charger which has a rating of 10W rather than the old chargers that used to come with the iPhone launched in Sep 2013. The old charger had a rating of 5W. So I can call myself lucky to charge my phone in a short span of time. Regarding the storage I reckon 16GB is good amount of space as I usually have my device connected to my iPad and Macbook. So shifting and clearing space is not an issue. I was previously using Moto G 3rd Gen and I agree the battery backup of the iPhone is no match to that of the Moto. But be rest assured that the iOS 9.1 that comes preloaded with the phone is fun. It's smooth and really very user-friendly. Lastly, if you guys are confused about the colour, let me tell you that the Champagne Gold colour and its production has been officially stopped by Apple. So unnecessary hoarding and demand-supply factors have led to an exorbitantly high price approx 6-8k higher than Silver and Space Grey. Don't go for Space Grey as it is after all an iPhone guys and you don't buy a Jaguar to keep it in the garage forever, would you? So my suggestion is that go for the Silver colour. It definitely looks more upmarket than the other two options. Enjoy with the purchase guys! Apple won't let you down!!!",1.0
"Firstly when I ordered it for just 21.49K i was very exited to have it! But then after ordering i read some fake reviews that were on to amazon wich said they received fake device! Wich was all fake reviews the device that i got was 100% genuine no doubt!!!Now about the device...its been 2 years since 5S was launched and still it runs the lattest version of iOS 9.2 that awesome about iOS still there are very minor lags wich you will barely notice! It handles my everyday work perfectly!! No doubt you won't regret after buying!!! The camera is good! The touch ID its very useful I really don't remember when I unlocked my iPhone with passcode last!! And it's also remarkably thin and light!! Best phone after all its apple!! I had a one plus 2, moto x play, nexus4,moto g 3rd gen and a yu yureka! And its sad that i wasted my money on shuch s***ty android devices now I know iPhone just for once cost much but is u get a gr8 deal on that you won't and shouldn't stop!!! Love this phone!!! Thanks Tim!!:)",1.0

"Reseller feedback - Though I received my iPhone without any delay however outer packing was pretty ordinary however product was intact. It was properly sealed and courier guy helped me opening the pack so that we can check any damage. Must improve packing ""Thebluedeals"" reseller.Product Review - I received the phone on 20th Dec'15 and so far the phone is working fine with no issue. Post activating I checked the serial number on apple website and this is a genuine purchase. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date.Price Deal - I got this product for rs 22500 which is lowest prices in past 2-3 weeks comparing (Amazon, Snapdeal & Flipkart).Recommendation - Guys must check re-sellers feedback & rating. And believe me you can trust Amazon.com and beware of fake feedbacks.Thank you Amazon for a great deal and awesome product.",1.0
"Planning to buy this aesthetically great product, as a gift from my D***, will update the review soon after the purchase and verification. It's been quite an experience to buy and opt for an iPhone. Hope it will be our companion of the ascetic ascent in the exploration of the Truth-The True Love and True Happiness. Jayatu Ramakrishna.Definitely, the stars will Rise :)Update-2Amazon Couriers should check the ID status of the customers, for paid services,at least. How they can be such immature to rely on someone's signature? Some other person can fake my identity to grasp it, with appropriate signature.Not an amazing packaging, Amazon should learn what packaging means, from Apple,Inc-how they can make the box a pristine piece of Art. However, taking a first hand glimpse of One of the Humanity's Best Innovations is a unique rich experience.Will Open and Activate iPhone on January 1, 2016.Will Update about that, too.",0.0

"Got the best deal possible with any apple product.Warranty is verified and totally valid.Being a developer I am no longer worried about signing devices any more (At least for next 4-5 years). So developers grab one asap if you need a cheaper phone to test your apps.If you find any deal thats better than mine go for it.However if you are switching from 4.5+ inches screen size phones, it may be difficult for you to accustom with the 4 inch screen 5s has, in regards with typing.

"It was time to upgrade my iPhone 4s. Was completely satisfied with iPhone experience, so the only thing to decide was which one to buy 5c or 5s. I would have bought the 5c because 5c is a good phone and I consider the sticker price 5s just too much. The discounted price on Amazon made iPhone 5s a better value proposition.The phone is really refined. Every feature works. A very safe choice.",1.0

"Genuine Product with Warranty!!!Initially I was bit sceptical about switching from Android 6 to iOS. But was using Mac so knew the benefits.Finally, I am happy that I took the right decision.# Only glitch, I feel is small screen size, that too while typing as I have very thick fingers.# Else size is just about perfect and handy. More thoughtful product than Samsung etc where they are making screen bigger & bigger and less handy.# You have to go through a transitional phase while shifting from one system to another. But with use you find iOS more thoughtful and organised.# Some apps look different in iOS than Android - But you get used to it very fast.Go for it!!! Recomendable!!!",1.0

"I don't like to carry brick-sized phones like nexus, galaxy, iPhone 6plus etc. iPhone 5S is just perfect for me. Prior to this I was using a Lumia720 which was a good phone I must say. Besides I have a obsession about the brand of Apple. Decision to buy a 5S was more inclined towards the brand obsession and of course the size factor (iPhone 6 looks more like samsung). I got it from amazon @ 32K- . Now lets talk about the feature...I am not a tech-freak, neither I use too many apps, nor I stayed glued to my phone whole day. Its pretty fast with its 1GB RAM. In battery backup my lumia was better. In browsing it has got the advantage of 4G, but that you get with nexus and I believe in samsung highline as well.(never explored samsung). iOS is good or precisely I should say that Apple h/w and iOS are just made for each other. But converting everything to iTunes is a pain. Unlike my windows phone where you don't need any PC-suite, just drag and drop works. (never liked/used android though). Some of very essential apps like skype, whatsapp have very poor ratings in AppStore. So before going for iOS just browse the AppStore for assessment of your needs.  Overall I am satisfied with the phone but that varies from person to person.",1.0

"I'm very happy with the phone mainly due to its convenient size. Performance wise it's good although the latest iOS I somehow believe is slowing down the phone.I use a second windows phone and when I have to compare the two, I find iOS much more stable and app friendly compared to windows. However interestingly, for who would be using emailing, Ms office, etc extensively, the windows phone surely scores over iOS there. The typing is another area where windows leads the comparison with a very accurate and convenient handwriting mode. Over all, the phone never disappoints you and hence I would rate this phone as a very good one if its a personal phone and not a work phone. The biometric sensor is just too good. I purchased the phone At 29k and at that price everything about the phone is worth my money. Amazon delivery and services 5 star as always.",1.0

Worst product and customer service. In 8 months there is black spot in phone and when i have visited the apple store they claim that the spot appearing on the screen is because of pressure damage. I have not put any pressure on the phone and handled it very carefully. This is a tactic by apple to sell their damage phone through online fraud websites like amazon.Request everyone not to buy this phone and if you buy assume its without warranty because anything happen with the phone in warranty they will not going to replace it.,0.0

"Iphone 5s is amazing phone. I am writing review after 1 month. Some tips for all........1. Keep your phone in charge when it reach 5 percentage or less, then charge it until get fully charged. Don't interrupt while charging because charging and discharging process is must to keep your mobile battery for long. Once the battery fully charged use upto battery reach 5 or less percentage as i said earlier. For me battery backup is coming upto 3 to 4 days in moderate use. Using wifi its coming upto 2 to 3days. Even heavy use 1.5 days to 2 days2. If you feel your iphone heats....Don't panic.... Iphone is build with metal, it may heat bit more while using internet,charging and playing.If you turn off location setting and make much less brightness. It will improve battery life.I am glad to have the iphone 5s... Soooooo Happy with the performance...Thank you Amazon and the seller cloudtail...",1.0

Anyone pls post apple website to check ime no for warranty confirmation...",1.0
"Writing this review after a week of usage:>Camera - good : Primary camera does take pics like an 8MP, front cam is a front cam and not a selfie cam, since I'm not a selfie addict 1.2MP is ok for me, its enough for making video calls>Audio : This was one of the key factors for which I painfully went through 100s of reviews of various phones.  Being a music listener and having experience HTC's beats audio, I must say Apple didn't disappoint me here.  But the earphone give only treble, very poor bass, since I had my own head phones it wasn't an issue for me.  Loud speaker is ok.>Battery : Its fine, though its just 1560mAh, it will last better than any android with this hardware config.  If your screen is on battery will drain a bit quickly, but if your phone is locked (not in use) it consumes very less battery.  Playing music won't eat battery too much.  For a moderate 3G usage, it will last one day.>Display : Very crystal clear, even if you go for higher ppi, our eyes can't distinguish...>Performance : Excellent, Having played 1080p videos, multitasked, for a handset with 1GB RAM, it beats all Android fair and square... No match...>Finger print sensor is accurate>The only reason I didn't give 5stars is because of the restrictions...!! Trust me, if you are an Android user, you will feel like 'HELL' for few days to get adjusted, can't even add contacts to your SIM, can't copy from VCF, u need to sync with iCloud... If you ask me why did go for this phone with all these restrictions, its because of the size, I really hate 5inch screen phones, this absolutely fits in my hand perfectly...>Lastly great delivery by Amazon, within 48hrs...",1.0

It shows Apple manufacturing warranty for 12months once you registered online. There is no problem in servicing also as Apple provides you warranty services for this phone (It is only some misconception around the people that it is not Apple Warranty if you purchase Online)..

"7th iphone 5s in the family. Its a great fone, got it for my mom. Amazon offered the best rate online. Quick delivery!",1.0
It's by far the best smartphone in the market which you can get. The iPhone 6 is way too costlier when compared to 5s and moreover the prices of 6 goes down when a new iPhone gets released. It's better to take when the prices of 6 goes down rather than buying a new and getting disappointed when you trade in. Thanks to Amazon for the steller deal got my iPhone 5s space gray for 30k the packaging and shipping was awesome. After the setup it showed me that my iPhone had 1 year apple India warranty from that day. It was an awesome moment i feel lucky to get at that price.Coming to iphone 5s and ios 8.1 one word flawless. I wonder why android phones need high end specs whole iphone can do it with much lower specs. Although the os restricts the user but it does well what it should do everything apple tells works perfectly. The display is crisp and the best one hand usage device. I still can't find an another iphone for this price my friends got shocked after I got at this price. Go for it!,1.0
"I bought iphone 5s for an excellent deal on amazon. The order was placed on 4th october and on 8th october i received it.It was received in an excellent packaging.Here is a short list of pros and cons after using it for few says and updating my phone to ios 8.1-Pros-1. Practically hangless- i belong tointense mobile user category (yeah by intense i really mean intense ;) .. But it nvr failed to keep up with my intensity.... The reason behind this is just like the story of the"" rabbit and the tortoise"".. Like the tortoise iphone 5s keeps working continuously at its dual core clock speed of 1.3 ghz unlike snapdragon giants of 2.7 ghz who operates only for 10-20 odd minutes on this frequency(rabbit) and for rest of time on the clock speed of 1.2-1.3 ghz2.Excellent built.. Its looks like some architectural craftwork not plastic crap3.Excellent display..dont go wooed up with ppi and etc..before this i was using an phone with 441ppi but its almostsame...yes probably 0.1% less crisp4.Excellent signal reception5.Best internal speakers i ever heard.. Yeah why do we buy phones?.. Right to make calls...trust me its internal speakers are really loud and clear6.Excellent camera-probably as good as samsung s4 camera7. Excellent customer care of apple- i just cant compare any other company's customer care service to apple's.... Its really the best in business.8.No discrimination-u get regular updates and get at the same time all over the world9. Excellent earphonesCons-1. Everything bound to itunes2. No bluetooth transfers3.ios is not even 10% as open as android...so if you are a tech freak like me dont go for ios4.No widgets5.expensive",1.0

"Got my first iPhone 5S for an amount of Rs. 35310/- .

It was not yet activated. Which means it's a grand new sealed IPhone.Month of manufacture Aug 2014.Happy & had a great sigh of relief.After all these above verifications , I handed over the money to delivery guy, I must say he was very supportive.Even the customer service people helped me a lot , responding to each & every questions I threw at them. Had a great to experience with Amazon staff.Well after using it for 10 days I'm very pleased with Apple. No lags , UI is superb, blazing fast performance, Camera one of the best among high end smart phones. Thanks Infinity Retail aka.

Mobile network doesn't work well, some times it doesn't show network/mobile data at all. Nobody knows when it picks up the network signal. I tested this with other mobiles and same service provider. Browser is like a snail going for running race. It takes forever to load. Some times it restarts itself automatically. It won't ring though the phone is in ringing mode. If you are using any Android phone, don't go for this phone. You will get awesome phones in this price range.THE WROST PHONEI thought of giving 0 star, but I don't see less than one star rating.",0.0

Still the BEST experience.The phone is undoubtedly very good. i have used all kinds of devices. Windows, Android, tablets. but the biggest thing that separates Apple from other OS or Hardware is the quality and UX (user experience).I am loving my iPhone. sometimes although i feel that its speed of responsive has gone slower bcz i have not put much data /music/movies in it yet but still i am happily ignoring it cuz it might just be nothing.",1.0

"I ordered an iPhone 5S through my brother's amazon account on 30th December 2014 and got the product on the morning of 1st Jan ( couldn't have asked for a better new year gift ). Amazon's Delivery is amazing and the product was a completely genuine one, No scratches nothing at all. Given how I am used to seeing comments of others users buying various items on e-commerce and a quite few of them giving negative feedbacks I was at first apprehensive to order one but gave the benefit of doubt and ordered one and trust me it's been an amazing experience with Amazon. About the phone : Well, need I say anything? It's the best phone your wallet can buy. Trust me everything else is just pale in comparison to this iPhone 5S.",1.0
"I bought this device for my dad as he wanted a sleek and light phone with a moderate screen size. This device fitted his requirement quite well. He liked his new phone very much and also,  he was impressed by Amazon as he belongs to ""go to the store"" generation. The iPhone 5s is a great device; I like the fingerprint security thing (kinda cool). He finds iphone little complicated as he used android before, which is obviously user-friendly, but soon he will get well acquainted. The craziest this is I bought this for Rs 29,999 in an offer by amazon, which is hard to believe. Amazon was a competitor to flipkart but you ask me, ""amazon is winning the race""But I am an anti Iphone guy. I feel this overrated piece of gadget. What I like is the touch and crisp display quality which a way better that android devices.",1.0

"I bought iphone 5s in october 2016 mega sale happening on all indian etailers.About snapdeal: believe me the way snapdeal has displayed its offers section and payment options to have different payment options like emi, it was not at all confusing. But I was totally confused on other etailer site ,for example how to club bank offers and emi option. Kudos for that simplicity. Now coming to delivery it was super fast as it got delivered next day itself as the seller was from the same city.About Phone: I was bit sceptical about buying an iphone online. So after getting it i immediately check for its authenticity on apple india websites by entering serial number of my iphone 5s. Was happy to see all the information related to authenticity and warranty available for one year for my phone. Kudos to the seller for providing authentic phone next day to my door.Performance: Phone is awesome. Battery charging is  super fast. Finger sensor is brilliant.Camera ,sound , brightness , performance all smooth like butter. My other colleagues also bought different phone of 15-20 k budget on the same day. And we do compare our photos taken , sound, and other performances . Believe me everyone acknowledge that iphone is iphone. Its 8 MegaPixel camera produces better photo quality than other's 14 megaPxl. On paper its processor , camera and other stuffs may look inferior to other flooding android phones of 15-20k budget but believe me iphone is optimized to produced excellent results. Kudos to apple engineers.",1.0

"No doubt the product is good and genuine. If anyone has a doubt5s runs very smooth. I don't like the screen sizes that are coming nowadays in iPhone. I just want to be stick with this screen size model. One handed usage is far better in every aspect. and with iOS 10 the device has got boost up, It has become so fast and multitasking is as fine as it was before or I would say a little bit better than before...Bottom of the line is that people who have a budget not more than 20-25k just go for this model... you will experience the latest iOS with decent specs.At last, I am sad because of the delivery time was 1 week. Maybe it's just because of the iPhone I couldn't wait but I expect a little bit more fast than what I experienced...",1.0

"There is no need to talk about  the iPhone 5S as the entire net is singing songs about the device. What I would like to review is the service provided by Snapdeal. I am an ardent buyer from Amazon and have always found them to be good with their service. Off late I found them a bit expensive and therefore I started looking at other ecom sites. In my search I found that iPhone 5S was available at the cheapest price on Snapdeal and I had the best EMI offer as well. The follow up of SD was too good to believe, I received regular updates from their shipping company and within 2 days I received my brand new iPhone 5S. I must put it on records that SD has caught up with the bigger players and is not only catching up with them but also beating them in their own game,",1.0

1st I glad to tell you that it is the original new Apple iPhone 5s from India box MRP 25000 for silver 16 gb . So it gets some new specs like iOS Version is 9 whether the old was 7 and its manufacturing date is april 2016. No problem at all and no heating issues because it's the original version and upgraded. So go on. But i want to mention here don't buy any apple 5s products from flipkart because they are fake and refurbished. So friends thanks to all and thanks to snapdeal . The delivery was as expected good . I'm enjoying this phone so much and hope you also ???????? ???? ???? ????,1.0

Best product pricing, i.e. 17805 (ordered from app), exceptional delivery and excellent packaging. Service was icing on the cake for the pride which I feel after buying the product.",1.0

I bought it 9 days back. Well its a good product. Gets a little heated while charging. I got it before the promised delivery date so good work by snap deal on that front. The box was neatly packed with all the accessories in good condition. Yet to use it in full throttle mode. So won't make any over enthusiastic comment. One feedback to snap deal is please increase the refund/exchange policy time period. 7 days is not enough for an electronic device. Flipkart has 30 days so at least make it 15 days or so. Over all satisfied as of now,1.0

"After long deliberation, I decided to pull the trigger, and go ahead with my first iPhone purchase, albeit for my mom, and I can't help but strongly recommend this product to others!The size of this phone in my opinion hits the sweet spot, as it is ideal for comfortable one hand use, and this was the biggest reason I went for the 5s for my mom, as she doesn't really use her phone to read much, which is the only benefit of owning the larger phablets. The quality of the camera is superlative, the touch is super responsive, and looks and build quality are just in a class of their own. Battery life is quite underwhelming, and that is the single biggest negative in this phone, but then again, battery life is the runt of the litter, and a neglected feature in almost all phones these days.But, the single biggest reason why I would recommend this product, is the iPhone user experience. You read and hear a lot about the seamless Apple software, and the benefits of hardware-software synergy, but you really have to see it in action to believe it. The phone is so so smooth, without any lags, which I've experience in almost all top Android phones at some time. The UI is extremely intuitive and user friendly, and my mother feels extremely happy and comfortable using the phone.It looks extremely good, will continue to get the latest software updates straight from Apple for the foreseeable time (the Iphone 4s, launched in late 2011, still gets iOS 9), is the ideal size if you don't use your phone as a reading device, and the camera and interface are superlative. Go for it!A note on Snapdeal and the seller - This was the best price I could find, and I literally searched everywhere. The delivery was comfortably quick, and hassle free. The customer care number actually connects without having to press too many numbers! 5/5",1.0

"Only one thing that i dont like is battery but new box comes with new chargere or adaptors which have fast charging ability you can nearly fully charge in 1 hour. Other features are just aweseom like camera which is just 8 megapixel back side but can take over many smartphones with 13 mg camera , night photography is alsobvery good ,also front camera does it job well,it is also pocket friendly with 4 inch screen,one of the most important thing buy it from snapdeal because you can get it in nearly 4000-5000 less bucks than those offered in market,i get my iphone in fully new sealed pack condition,i also checked iphone and its accessories and they are 100% original, i have also checked my warranty and its is of full one year,if you want to check your warranty go to apple india website  and open support in that scroll down and select service and support then select service and support coverage then enter your serial number in the space provided on the page which opens, you can check your serial number in settings-general-about phone -scroll down there you will see your serial number. And finally i will tell you you can definately go with this iphone 5s its good in comparison to many other phones in this price segment.

I was also not ready to pay in advance as I am a bit skeptic about pre-payment.I have been an android user so far and some people told me that Apps availability is an issue with iPhone.

There's nothing that can be said about an iPhone that hasn't already been said. It's probably the best experience that you can have from a Smart Phone.What surprised me was the Snapdeal experience. This is my first purchase from them. I got it for the lowest price available across all the other other sites.  I got a July 2015 manufactured model and not some old piece stored in the warehouse for over a year. The delivery was as per the mentioned deadlines. Although they can improve there as contenders like Amazon always deliver well before time.All in all it was a good experience and I didn't face any hassle all through the process.,1.0

"First snapdeal service was great. This was my first purchase from snapdeal as I've shifted away from flipkart and snapdeal didn't disappoint with packaging or delivery. Infact the product was delivered on Sunday.Product was genuine and as per description. I had to pay Rs. 500 to the apple guy to get the system activated. He refused to give bill for that as well. Anyway, not snapdeal's fault.As per phonePros-1. system never hangs, it's so smooth no matter how many apps are open at same time.2. it's so easy to switch between open apps.3. body seems sturdy4. picture quality is great and slow motion video recording is great as wellCons1. we don't play games on phone, neither do we see movies or else, still while browsing the handset heats up.2. keyboard for hindi is poor. some words can't be typed.3. typing isn't comfortable for me. though for someone with smaller hands it should be fine.4. button for silent mode isn't convenient. I feel like it's designed to be used in left hand.Overall a good phone. Pricey, but I expect this product to last longer than other fancy ones.I personally prefer qwerty keypad phones.

"Its one of the best phones,The main reason I go with Iphones is camera and software features.Camera: a larger Æ?/2.2 aperture and The pixels are larger too â?? 1.5 microns, to be exact. All this means more light enters the shutter and it produces better pictures in dark. This is important because a casual user like me takes most of pics in parties, tube light lit rooms, home.. etc..etc.. i think most cameras today in any smartphones are good if you are looking for outdoor photography in bright light. but to be honest I have observed most of the pics I took in past yrs were with frenz in places like eating joints, coffee shops etc.. and in aras like these it matters how much light gets into camera sensors. Megapixels are just numbers, I dont need my pics to be printed on some banner. so 8 MP is good enough for me. Also the true tone flashlight is great in poor light areas.Software: I believe off lately android has caught up with apple on app ecosystem. so I dont think thats where Ios shines. Its real strength is its integration and control. for eg features like which app can access my location and use background service or use my contacts. I can never control on such granular level in Android. and all these apps drawing data in backgrounds do impact battery even if its minimal. so I simply turn off background refresh on apps I don't need. Android doesn't offer me this feature. Another brilliant example of tight integration and control is updates. I can be rest assured of upda",1.0

"It delivers each and every thing with perfection.Blazing fast processor.Well optimized OS.A great looking phone not only looks but also it excels in performance too Apple is a premium brand which provide premium service at common parlance.Our believe that mobile technology of today is very advance is totally a Myth. 1. OS - its about smoothness and user interference and new feature with latest update . This OS totally upgradeable to the best available OS at that point of time. Unlike Andriod which only 6% devices run on latest OS whereas if you want latest Andriod OS buy new phone which is not in case of apple. Even iphone 4(5 year old phone ) run on latest OS . So you can safely assume this also have same life. 2. Self Life - As state 5 years at least. 3. Apps - As stated above believe that mobile technology of today is very advance is incorrect. Each and every application is need to be made on the very phone for which you are developing it for. Otherwise this will leads to drain of battery, Crashes, Usability of OS and even Software erosion.( this is why BBM not work well on andriod ) . Each phone is different so developers need to develop it for each device which is not possible. This is why apple produce now only 2 a year and apps on your devices crashes. 4. Otherwise apps - Movies and Music are available to download for price which are not too high. Downloading them free is actually illegal. 5. LTE Ready. India will have LTE by September 2014. 6. Security - After blackberry this most secured OS . 7. Screen - though 4 inch but you shall never feel it small . 8. Limited Storage - In order to tackle piracy apple cannot give expandable memory. Those who give they don't have that kind of library of music and Movies. 9. Camera - Best of the rest . All picture look exactly real especially the Sky. Forget MP it is all about zooming . We take picture at close of 2Metre max so why you need more than 8 MP ?? if want to zoom buy standalone camera. Front Camera is heaven for Selfie. 10. Otherwise Hardware- 1 GB and Dual core only ?? if you still think that after reading the review - READ IT AGAIN. OS and apps are optimize as per the Hardware and vice versa thus no issue . Those Quad core and Octa Core phones are no match for iphones as former are simply upgraded to to bridge the Gap of app compatibility issue. 11. Metal body 12. Fringerprint scanner - give it a miss it is still at very initial stage.",1.0

"After exhausting research, review, many many suggestions and with lots and lots of confusions, I finally ordered my iphone 5s 16gb gold with snapdeal. As the name suggests (snapdeal), its the spot on and reasonable deal with best in class service, when compared with other online dealers, who fakes their offers, with an asterix (condition applies), but snapdeal doesnt in this way. So, the day of truth came and I was still in a dilemma about the product genuity and the way it will be delivered (broken box),even after ordering, but everything vanished just in a sparkle, when snapdeal delivered me the genuine product with a best in class offer and a fully sealed and protected box. Snapdeal customer care executive are well trained with good mannerism, unlike other dealers(both online and shop keepers).  Even Though, Im not a perfect critic to write about apple products. But still, i truly wanted to explain my experience with this classy phone, that is user friendly, compact, good battery, breathtaking camera and ofcourse, not to forget about the sound quality. what about the panel?, i would say a ""WOW"", hardest ever panel after nokia ,in its earliest period, not to compare thou.

I had to literally wait another full day before opening the pack, as I wanted to welcome New Year Gudhi Padva with iphone.The product came in standard packing, of course great brand  and I am sure I wont need to seek any brand warranty. Probably I would not have bought the iphone 5s at all, unless for the price offered by snapdeal. In fact when I was looking for the iphone intially it never occurred to me to look for online shopping of the same. And the price quoted by Snapdeal created a momentary doubt about the phone quality.

"The phone is excellent and no doubt about it, but I was unhappy with the delivery especially the bluedart. It was delayed and finally had to collect it personally from their office. For all those who are concerned about the warranty, I have checked mine and can see that it carry 1 year Apple warranty. You can check your's by entering the serial number in apple support website.",1.0

"From a distance, the iPhone 5S looks almost like a replica of the iPhone 5. This is both a good, as well as a bad thing, depending on what you're seeking. If you're happy with the compact form factor of the iPhone 5, then you have a reason to cheer since most high-end flagships come with big screens and often sacrifice ergonomics and usability. However, if you're someone looking for a big display, you're in for repeated disappointment. I feel the display is still the best in its class offering excellent brightness, wide viewing angles, and under-sun legibility. Images and text look crisp and sharp, and if you're happy with the screen size, you don't really have much to complain about.The Home button, which is the only key on the front, is located just below the display, but sports a silver ring around it. It's one of the few visible changes that you'd see in the iPhone 5S. Its purpose is much more than being a cosmetic enhancement. It is part of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor which is integrated with the Home button and offers an alternative way of securing the phone.The iPhone 5S is the first widely available smartphone to be powered by a chip that features 64-bit architecture. Apple also claims that its A7 chip delivers CPU and graphics performance up to two times faster than its predecessor. the speed bump is not related to the processor being 64-bit. Though it lays the foundation of the future; the 64-bit architecture will help in better memory management and will work in tandem with apps optimized for it as they're made available. It also supports OpenGL ES 3.0 standard for enhanced graphics performance especially while playing 3D games.The phone charges really quick, so if you do carry a charger, you can re-energize your iPhone in a jiffy. While Apple already offers a 4 digit passcode lock to protect the iPhone, the Touch ID offers a simple, yet effective way to authenticate the phone for unlocking it, or while purchasing content from the App Store and iTunes Store.It's worth pointing out that you'll still need to set-up a pass code and verify at at certain times, in addition to verifying the biometric fingerprint.Up to five impressions of fingers (including thumbs) can be added. This means that you can also add finger impressions of different individuals, in case more than one person uses the phone.The camera on the iPhone 5S offers a 15% larger sensor, bigger pixels and an f/2.2 aperture to allow more light to come in. The improved optics result in much better low-light pictures compared to the ones shot with an iPhone 5. The level of noise and distortion while capturing lit objects in low-light conditions, is much lower in pictures taken with the iPhone 5S. We also found colour reproduction to be more accurate, and white balance to be in perfect harmony, thanks to the new image signal processor, part of the phone's A7 chip.Having said that, even if you're not an iOS user but want to invest in a device that will last you more than an year (even two years), receive regular software updates, deliver a consistent camera and stable software experience, and offer a premium yet solid look and feel, then we'd recommend the iPhone 5S.Other Great Features1. Slow Motion Camera works Great2. Hyperlaps video3. Facetime and iMessage that are free to use.4. One year india warranty and genuine5. battery works for 15 hrs approx. I charge my phone twice in 25 hrs as i am hooked on to it a lot with Wifi/3G.6. Best when used with 3G.You can go ahead to buy this phone as the prices are less now after iPhone 6 launch. Do like review to help others.",1.0

"The iPhone 5S is one of the best phones to be launched in the past year, although the screen size seems small since the standard has moved to around 5-inches now. The 4-inch screen is still excellent. It is bright, colourful and responsive. The phone is very fast too. I've not experienced any detrimental slowdown in the weeks since I;ve bought it. The iPhone 5S has an aluminium body that feels premium and solid, yet manages to remain incredibly light. There's is not much to say about the iPhone 5S's performance here other than thats it's blisteringly fast and very reliable. I've not experienced any issues with apps misbehaving other than the Google Maps hanging occasionally. It's annoying but may be as much down to the app as to the phone.The battery life could have been better though. And I have to say that the 4 inch screen would be a deal breaker for many, especially at this price point. But take it from me, you will never regret buying this phone because it is just a simply awesome phone. As they say, good things come in small packages.",1.0

"Its one of the best phones,The main reason I go with Iphones is camera and software features.Camera: a larger ƒ/2.2 aperture and The pixels are larger too — 1.5 microns, to be exact. All this means more light enters the shutter and it produces better pictures in dark. This is important because a casual user like me takes most of pics in parties, tube light lit rooms, home.. etc..etc.. i think most cameras today in any smartphones are good if you are looking for outdoor photography in bright light. but to be honest I have observed most of the pics I took in past yrs were with frenz in places like eating joints, coffee shops etc.. and in aras like these it matters how much light gets into camera sensors. Megapixels are just numbers, I dont need my pics to be printed on some banner. so 8 MP is good enough for me. Also the true tone flashlight is great in poor light areas.Software: I believe off lately android has caught up with apple on app ecosystem. so I dont think thats where Ios shines. Its real strength is its integration and control. for eg features like which app can access my location and use background service or use my contacts. I can never control on such granular level in Android. and all these apps drawing data in backgrounds do impact battery even if its minimal. so I simply turn off background refresh on apps I don't need. Android doesn't offer me this feature. Another brilliant example of tight integration and control is updates. I can be rest assured of updates for next 3 Years. I know android does that, but only with nexus devices and that too only for 2 years. Last but not the least. I can at least rest in peace knowing that If god forbid I ever loose my phone, I dont loose my data and most important the person stealing it will not get anything because of i-cloud activation lock.",1.0
Product is in best shape n manufacturer packing and product is next gen iphone which is best suited fr ios7 with 64 bit architecture. The lightweight and slim iphone body design is just amazing enhanced with 2gb ram for never lagging experience. Iphone 5s gold colour gives it a distinct identification from all other phones n fingerprint security is just what i need the most,1.0
